# Shell Scripting Bible Practice

This repository contains my practice scripts and exercises inspired by the *Shell Scripting Bible* book.  
Itâ€™s a personal learning space where I experiment with shell commands, Bash scripting techniques, and automation concepts.

## Goals
- Strengthen my command-line skills.
- Learn to write efficient and reusable shell scripts.
- Build a habit of documenting and sharing my progress.

## How to Use
Each script is executable and can be run from the terminal.  
Example:
```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
./script_name.sh
